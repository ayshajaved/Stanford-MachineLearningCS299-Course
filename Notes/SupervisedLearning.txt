Training set -> Learning algorithm -> Hypothesis ->Output
What represents the hypothesis?
h(x) = θ0 + θ1x1 + θ2x2 + ... + θnxn linear regression
explain the equation:
The equation represents a linear regression model, where h(x) is the predicted output, and x is the input feature. The θ values are the parameters of the model that are learned during the training process. The equation essentially represents a linear combination of the input features and the parameters, with the output being a continuous value.
In the context of the diagram, the hypothesis represents the learned relationship between the input features and the output
